"MODX Boilerplate" is a HTML5/CSS3/jQuery based frontend template for further usage.

This package can be used with MODX CMF Revolution and is thought as a basic rock solid HTML5 website template. It has some speed improvements, fallbacks for old browsers and IE.

NOTE:
It is not a direct clone of the original HTML5Boilerplate by Paul Irish. I've stripped some content which is not needed and implemented some other speedy scripts.

CONTENT:

- HTML5 Boilerplate HTML Body
- jQuery 1.5.1
- basic CSS with reset
- htaccess File (MODX + Boilerplate)
- favicons / apple touch icons
- robots.txt
- modernizr with HTML5Shim + Modernizr.load/yepnope.js (JS-Loadhelper)
- webfontloadenhancer
- CSS Grid 1140px

HOW TO USE THE RIGHT THINGS:

If you want to use the Grid system, please take the files of the "main_fluid_grid"-folder and replace the original ones with them.


SETUP:

1. Download all files and upload to your server in right folder structure
2. Unpack them
3. Customize all paths, URLs and App-IDs
4. Create the MODX-chunks:
	- site_header
	- site_footer
5. Create the MODX template and paste code from site_template.html
6. Replace the Revolution .htaccess file with this one and customize 
7. Customize all the other files!
8. Test it out.

IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR DEVELOPMENT:

- yepnope.js always executes things in the order they are listed. This is very important to know because it can hurt the speed of your website critically!

- If you need more than basic HTML5 support enabling with modernizer please pack your own: http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/2.0-beta/ I only applied Audio,Cideo,Canvas,appCache,postMessage,InputTypes,InputAttributes.  No GeolocAPI,SVG,WebGL, SMIL support is enabled, too.
