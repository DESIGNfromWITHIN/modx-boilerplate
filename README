"MODX Boilerplate" is a HTML5/CSS3/jQuery based frontend template for further usage.

This package can be used with MODX CMF Revolution and is thought as a basic rock solid HTML5 website template. It has some speed improvements, fallbacks for old browsers and IE.

NOTE:
It is not a direct clone of the original HTML5Boilerplate by Paul Irish. I've stripped some content which is not needed and implemented some other speedy scripts.
