"MODX Boilerplate" is a HTML5/CSS3/jQuery based frontend template for further usage.

This package can be used with MODX CMF Revolution and is thought as a basic rock solid HTML5 website template. It has some speed improvements, fallbacks for old browsers and IE.

NOTE:
It is not a direct clone of the original HTML5Boilerplate by Paul Irish. I've stripped some content which is not needed and implemented some other speedy scripts.

CONTENT:

- HTML5 Boilerplate HTML Body
- jQuery 1.5
- control.js
- basic CSS with reset
- htaccess File (MODX + Boilerplate)
- favicons / apple touch icons
- robots.txt
- modernizr 2beta
- webfontloadenhancer


SETUP:

1. Download all files and upload to your server in right folder structure
2. Unpack them
3. Customize all paths, URLs and App-IDs
4. Create the MODX-chunks:
	- site_header
	- site_footer
5. Create the MODX template and paste code from site_template.html
6. Replace the Revolution .htaccess file with this one and customize 
7. Customize all the other files!
8. Test it out.
